        <h1>Javascript Projects</h1>
        <p>Below you will find various Javascript programs that I have created in the CSC 106 course at the University of Rhode Island with the help of Khan Academy tools. As you venture farther down this page, you will see the progress I have made with the use of Javascript and coding as a whole!</p>

                    <p>An avatar constucted with the use of various shapes and colors, made to resemble me! By manipulating different shapes and colors within the program, I was able to create different facial and clothing features within this avatar to make it look like a person!</p>

                    <p>Using both the avatar I constucted and a bunny from a Khan Academy challenge, each time the program is run, the two figures race diagonally across the screen. Both the x-axis and y-axis are randomized in order for the results to possibly be different each time. </p>

                    <p>In this program an avatar is moved about the screen when the user's mouse moves. If the mouse is clicked, approaches 10 pixels to the left edge, or approaches 10 pixels to the right edge, the program displays an "out of bounds" message. When clicking "restart" to run this program, ensure that your mouse is moving about the screen! </p>

                    <p>This program was created to help the user decide what they should do on their day off. By clicking "yes" or "no" to each of the questions, the program will either guide you to a new question or display a text saying what I think you should do! After the program concludes, a restart button is provided if you would like to start over! </p>

Each time this is run, the program cycles through and randomly chose 1 out of 3 inspirational quotes to display. Furthermore, it will also randomly choses 6 numbers, ranging from 0 to 100, to display. As an addition, you will see a smaller version of my avatar on the bottom left!</p>

                    <p>This program, outputs a 6x6 dance floor covering the entirety of the canvas. As this program operates at 1 FPS, each tile of the dance floor changes colors randomly according to the frame rate. Additionally, the avatar I previously created was scaled down by 0.5 and is displayed twice on the screen, randomly changing positions with each new frame. </p>

                    <p>With the use of arrays, this program simulates a tag game between the user and the avatar I have created previously. Each of the 50 avatars move across the screen randomly at speed 1 or 2. If clicked by the user, they will disappear. If they reach the right side of the canvas, they will reappear coming from the left side, randomizing their speed again. </p>

                    <p>Using objects in Javascript, two of the avatars I have created above are displayed, both with different properties. As the function was called to display each avatar, the size, location, shirt color, and presence of initials were different for each. By allowing the function to accept objects as a parameter, I was able to seamlessly change the different properties of each. </p>

                    <p>This program creates a contacts list that displays a numerous <br> amount of information. At the top, you will see a smaller <br> version of my avatar along with "Carly's Contacts". You will <br> also see a list of names that are included in my contacts. <br> When you click each name, each individials name, phone <br> number, email, job, and rating will appear. To view another's <br> contact, simply restart the program. </p>

                    <p>Using many of the coding techniques learned, I have created <br> an interactive game wiht Javascript. After the game is started, <br> the player has 6 seconds to click the avatar as much as <br> possible. At the start of the game, the avatar moves slowly and <br> will increase each time the player recieves 5 points which will <br> level you up. Additionally, as the player goes to the next level, <br> the background color will change!</p>
