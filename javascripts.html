        <h1>Javascript Projects</h1>
        <p>Below you will find various Javascript programs that I have created in the CSC 106 course at the University of Rhode Island with the help of Khan Academy tools. As you venture farther down this page, you will see the progress I have made with the use of Javascript and coding as a whole!</p>

                    <h2>Digital Avatar</h2>
                    <p>An avatar constucted with the use of various shapes and colors, made to resemble me! By manipulating different shapes and colors within the program, I was able to create different facial and clothing features within this avatar to make it look like a person!</p>

                    <h2>Dancing Avatar</h2>
                    <p>Displays the same avatar shown on the left however, each time the program is run, the avatar randomly moves about the screen on the x-axis. With the randomization of the x-axis, it allows for the avatar to randomly move about the screen, resembling it dancing! </p>

                    <h2>Racing Avatar</h2>
                    <p>Using both the avatar I constucted and a bunny from a Khan Academy challenge, each time the program is run, the two figures race diagonally across the screen. Both the x-axis and y-axis are randomized in order for the results to possibly be different each time. </p>
